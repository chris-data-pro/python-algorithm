Video Title: Humanitarian Insights from Data Analytics
Video URL: 
 Businesses aren't the only ones that benefit from analytics. There are many examples of how humanitarian organizations are using the power of data to better serve their communities and the world. (upbeat music) Humanitarian aid organizations use insights gained from data analysis to predict the impacts of droughts and other weather events. The information obtained enables them to muster the appropriate resources to minimize the impact of vulnerable populations. The data from satellites, sensors, cameras, and even social media posts inform organizations about the numbers and locations of displaced persons that may need aid. Data collected during the recent pandemic informs researchers and medical personnel of how a virus might spread and mutate, ensuring that they can be better prepared in the future. IoT sensors and everyday things such as water pumps enable social entrepreneurs to determine how the individual pumps are operating and predict failures before they impact water supplies.
