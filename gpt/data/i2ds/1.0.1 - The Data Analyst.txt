 Data analytics is changing our world right now while you're watching this video. It is helping us make decisions, navigate through traffic, and even predict the best match-ups in your favorite team's lineup. Analytics are enabling us to address challenges that seemed impossible just a short time ago. Every day in the news, there are exciting stories about data-driven innovations in manufacturing, healthcare, space exploration, and many more. Data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic enabled governments and organizations across the globe to track outbreaks and mobilize resources. Taiwan, for example, used their National Health Insurance and Immigration Databases to create an outline of travel histories and symptoms of every person that left or entered the country. This type of creative analytical problem solving allowed health professionals to be better prepared to diagnose and identify the disease. In this course, you will learn the basic features and functions of data analytics, how data is collected and where it is stored, how data enables artificial intelligence and machine learning, and you will begin your journey to become a data professional. There are many opportunities to help drive forward these innovations as data analysts, scientists, and engineers. This is a rewarding career with the potential to really make a difference. Join us as we explore what is possible. (light music continues)
