Video Title: Data Usage in Daily Life
Video URL: 
 The collection and analysis of data is making information readily available for many different purposes. We are more connected than ever. In our home, schools, work, and even the areas in which we play, advancements in technologies are generating large quantities of data. Everywhere you go and everything you do in this digital world becomes a new source of data. Data is being generated from sensors, devices, video, audio, networks, log files, transactional applications, the web, and social media. It is more commonly streaming over the networks and comes in a variety of sizes and formats. Among the uses for data in our daily lives are informing our decision-making. From the product recommendations that we see on our shopping sites to performance statistics on athletes to which groceries to stock in the market, our decisions are influenced by the results of data science and AI. Identifying the improvements to processes and products. Through the ability to use data collected from product reviews and ratings, manufacturers can modify designs or change their processes to produce and deliver better products to their consumers. Tracking and predicting events. One of the greatest benefits we can realize from analytics is the ability to track, isolate, and even predict events. A network engineer can use a dashboard to isolate areas of slowdown and immediately react to ensure it doesn't cause problems for users. Climate analysts can accurately predict the impacts of weather on all aspects of our economies. Self-driving cars can recognize hazards and take actions to avoid accidents. Enabling greater visibility into behaviors. Organizations now have greater visibility into how their products are used, the buying patterns of their customers, and the up-to-date logistical information to manage their lead times. This additional level of visibility enables managers to ensure that the right products are available for their customers in the shortest time possible. (uplifting music)
