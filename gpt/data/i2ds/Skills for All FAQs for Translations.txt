Using the “Keep me logged in” feature is only recommended for private computers. If you are using a public or shared computer, you should NOT use the “Keep me logged in” option or you should ensure that you Logout before closing Cisco Packet Tracer to prevent other users of the computer gaining access using your credentials.



Can I use activities created in a prior Packet Tracer version with Packet Tracer 8.1? 383

Yes. Packet Tracer 8.1.0 supports activities authored in previous versions of Packet Tracer. There is a small possibility you may encounter some warning messages.

Can I use a new activity created in Packet Tracer 8.1 with a prior version of Packet Tracer? 384

Packet Tracer Activities (.pka files) authored or saved with Packet Tracer 8.1 can only be used with version 8.1 of the software or higher. Prior Packet Tracer versions cannot load Packet Tracer 8.1 data files; they will display an incompatibility message.



What if students download and use Packet Tracer 8.1 but their instructor is using a prior version? 386

Please note that if a student using Packet Tracer 8.1 creates a new activity, or saves an activity originally created in a prior version of Packet Tracer, it will not open correctly in an older version of Packet Tracer. If the student submits the activity to an instructor who is using an older version of Packet Tracer, it will display an error message. The instructor will need to upgrade to Packet Tracer 8.1 to open the file, or the student will need to redo their work in the older version of Packet Tracer. To prevent this from occurring, please ensure that students use the same version of Packet Tracer for homework assignments that are being used by the instructor and in the classroom lab. We strongly recommend all students and instructors to upgrade to the latest version of Cisco Packet Tracer.

Why should I learn Python? 473

It is omnipresent, people use numerous Python-powered devices on a daily basis, whether they realize it or not.

There have been millions (well, actually billions) of lines of code written in Python, which means almost unlimited opportunities for code reuse and learning from well-crafted examples. What’s more, there is a large and very active Python community, always happy to help.

There are also a couple of factors that make Python great for learning:

It is easy to learn – the time needed to learn Python is shorter than for many other languages; this means that it’s possible to start the actual programming faster;

It is easy to use for writing new software – it’s often possible to write code faster when using Python;

It is easy to obtain, install and deploy – Python is free, open and multiplatform; not all languages can boast that.

If you’re not familiar with any other languages, Python is great to begin with, because it will give you a solid foundation and allow you to learn other programming languages (e.g., C++, Java, or C) much easier and much faster. Learning Python is fun and trendy!

Doing the course will teach you how to design, write, debug, and run programs encoded in Python, the programming language used by start-ups and tech giants alike.



What is Python actually used for? 474

Generally, Python is a great choice for:



Testing (e.g., unittest, pytest, Autotest, Doctest, or Nose; test automation)

Security (e.g., requests, Scapy, Nmap, Yara, or Beautiful Soap; malware analysis, host discovery, sending/decoding packets, scanning ports, scanning network, accessing servers,

Web and Internet development (e.g., Django and Pyramid frameworks, Flask and Bottle micro-frameworks)

Scientific and numeric computing (e.g., SciPy – a collection of packages for the purposes of mathematics, science, and engineering; Ipython – an interactive shell that features editing and recording of work sessions)

Machine Learning and AI projects (e.g., Keras, TensorFlow, Pytorch)

Desktop GUIs (e.g., wxWidgets, Kivy, Qt)

Software Development (build control, management, and testing – Scons, Buildbot, Apache Gump, Roundup, Trac)

Business applications (ERP and e-commerce systems – Odoo, Tryton) [Source:https://www.python.org/about/aps]

and…Education!(Yes, it’s a brilliant language for teaching programming! That’s why we’re offering this course to you!)



The largest organizations that use Python include Cisco, Google, CERN, NASA, Yahoo, Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, Spotify, or Wikipedia!



How long will it take to complete the Python Essentials course? 475

The entire course is designed to be completed in about 30 hours when taken self-paced, but academies and instructors are encouraged to use the courseware and teaching resources based on the actual needs of the academic institution and students (e.g., offer each part as an independent mini-course taught over a semester).



Is there a digital badge for the Python Essentials course? 476

Yes, Python Essentials 1 offersa digital badge for successfully completing the course.



What jobs align with the Python Essentials course? 477

The course will prepare the student for jobs/careers connected with widely understood software development, which includes not only creating the code itself as a junior developer, but also computer system design and software testing.

It could be a stepping-stone to learning any other programming language, and to explore technologies using Python as a foundation (e.g., Django). Moreover, Python is the preferred programming language for developers pursuing a career in Security, Networking, and the Internet-of-Things (IoT).

This course is distinguished by its affordability, friendliness, and openness to the student. It starts from the absolute basics, guiding the student step by step to complex problems, making her/him a responsible software creator able to take on different challenges in many positions in the IT industry.

A knowledge of programming is one of the crucial skills for network administrators. It helps them to better understand the functionality as well as the potential of network devices. Network engineers and network administrators with knowledge of programming in at least one powerful language are highly sought-after in the job market today for the unique combination of their skills and ability to successfully deal with non-standard network issues.



Does the Python Essentials course align with any industry-recognized certification? 478

Yes, this course aligns with thePCEP – Certified Entry-Level Python Programmercertification from the Python Institute.

PCEP - Certified Entry-Level Python Programmercertification is an interim step to the PCAP - Certified Associate in Python Programming certification, and the starting point to launch a career in software development, Python programming, and related technologies. The PCEP exam is available online via the OpenEDG Testing Service (see PCEPTesting Policies).

Becoming PCEP certified will help you stand out from other candidates and get your foot in the door, while becoming PCAP certified ensures that you are fully acquainted with all the primary means provided by Python 3 to enable you to start your own studies, and to open a path to the developer's career. The PCAP exam is available through the network of Pearson VUE Testing Centers and OnVUE Online Proctoring from Pearson VUE (see PCAPTesting Policies).



What is the value of the Python Institute certification? 479

With the growing need for Python programmers, it is important to gain recognition for your programming expertise and be able to prove your skills. An employer does not only look at your portfolio, but also searches for different ways to validate your knowledge.

A certificate is frequently the first screening tool used by a recruiter to help select those candidates who will have a chance to show off their skills during an interview. Failing to get through the very first selection process makes it impossible for even a great programmer to be noticed, and this is a strong argument for getting certified and paying particular attention to your self-development.

Python Institute certification can be a powerful weapon in the race for better employment, first-rate expertise and greater competitiveness.

The certification can open doors to a better job and a better salary. It is a great motivator for self-improvement and self-development. It is one of the key requirements set by an increasing number of IT managers and, frequently, a standard criterion for candidates among recruiters.

Python Institute certification is proof to the employer that you possess the expertise necessary to fulfil certain duties. At the same time, it is a sign for them that you are willing to expand your knowledge. And because certified individuals directly contribute to an increase in a company’s efficiency, productivity and profit-making capacity, Python Institute certification is an asset for every organization.

To read more about the value of Python Institute certification, please visit theWhy Get Certifiedpage at http://pythoninstitute.org/why-get-certified.



Is there any discount for the Python Institute certification exams? 480

Currently there is no discount for the certification exam, but we are working closely with the Python Institute and the discount will be offered soon. Please keep checking the course web page for updates.



Is instructor training or any certification required to teach the Python Essentials course? 481

No special instructor training or qualification is required to teach this course.
