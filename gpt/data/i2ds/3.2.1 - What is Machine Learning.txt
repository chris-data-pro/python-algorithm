Video Title: What is Machine Learning
Video URL: 
 It's all the rage these days, companies touting machine learning this or machine learning that, vendors promising a cure-all for every IT challenge. The hype is getting pretty thick. So, what exactly is machine learning? Traditionally, computers solve problems through programs or instructions given to them by a human. Machine learning just means the computer can figure out a solution without being specifically programmed. These machines have the ability to continuously learn by looking at data and finding patterns, and they do this much faster than a human could. Let's look at two key terms in machine learning: classifiers and algorithms. Classifiers are the workhorse of machine learning that categorize observations, while algorithms are the techniques that organize and orient classifiers. Often, machine learning requires training with sets of correct question and answer pairs that lets both the classifier and the algorithms do great work. Let's look at an example to see how it works. Classifiers analyze specific data patterns, not actual noses or eyes. And with enough training, they can pick your photo out of millions of options. So, how do we use machine learning in security? Envision an analytics pipeline that uses many hundreds of machine learning classifiers and algorithms all working together, analyzing millions of internal and external data points and events. The pipeline identifies and separates suspected malicious activity from the normal. It's then organized into specific events and then combined with actionable context for security teams. And it does all this at machine speed. Pretty amazing, right?
