Video Title: The Data Engineer
Video URL: 
 Here at Data Crunchers, data engineers ensure accessibility and availability of data for data scientists and data analysts. Data engineers integrate data from different sources and even perform some data cleaning. More data is being generated and stored than ever before. It's estimated that 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are generated each day. All this generated data must be securely stored and then processed for analysis. In this module, we will discuss the types of data being collected and where it's being stored. In some environments, there's likely to be some overlap between the roles of data analysts, data scientists, and even data engineers. There is no denying that this is a very exciting time to be a data engineer. (bright music)
