Video URL: 
 Data science enables businesses to better understand the impact of their products and services, adjust their methods and goals and provide the customers with better products faster. The insights gain from data analysis can make a difference to the success of the business, as well as to the lives of their employees. There are multiple types of analysis that provide businesses with information that can drive innovation, improve efficiency and mitigate risk. The type of analytics to implement will depend on the problem that needs to be solved or questions that need to be answered. Trend analysis is one way to gain insights into key performance indicators, KPI, over time. One of our clients at Data Crunchers is a bicycle store that is having difficulty with attracting new customers. We can use analysis of the types of bicycles or services that their previous new customers purchased and during what time of the year they made their purchases. This analysis identifies trends in these purchases, such as many new customers are buying certain types of bikes at a specific time of the year. The store uses this information to purchase advertising during those time periods to target new buyers. Afterwards, store management can analyze sales data to determine the effectiveness of the advertising. Analytics can also be used to predict customer behaviors, gauge user satisfaction and even to identify patterns that can be used to train machines to perform complex functions.
