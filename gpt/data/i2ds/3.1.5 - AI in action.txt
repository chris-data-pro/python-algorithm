 There are many exciting, time-saving uses for artificial intelligence technologies. Copy.AI is an AI-powered platform that helps you create blog entries, add copy, course pages, and more. You can even use it to write your next blog entry in just minutes. To use the Text Creation tool, enter the purpose, a few key words or phrases, and the text style that is appropriate for your purpose. As you can see, there are many different styles available. The Text Creation tool has access to a library of pre-written, natural language content and tools that you can customize. Once I click Create Copy, the tool presents several options for what kind of content it thinks would work best based on your information. You can choose which one appeals most to you based on the tone, length, and style, then customize it further if it doesn't meet all of your needs. The script for this video was prepared using the Text Creation tool. (gentle music)
