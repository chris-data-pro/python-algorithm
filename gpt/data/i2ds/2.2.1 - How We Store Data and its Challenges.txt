Video Title: How We Store Data and its Challenges
Video URL: 
 The rise of big data means that more data is being generated and stored than ever before. The explosion of big data is responsible for 80% to 90% of all generated data, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. All this generated data must be stored and then processed for analysis. This requires infrastructure specifically designed to securely store, manage and retrieve virtually limitless volumes of data, which could be a challenge for traditional on premises legacy data warehousing solutions. A data warehousing solution, stores data and files or folders in an organized manner that is readily available for reporting and data analysis. Traditional data warehousing solutions are best suited for structured data. They are not optimized to handle the large volumes of complex high velocity, unstructured big data and are challenged by the three v's of big data, volume, variety, and velocity. Big data requires distributed scalable non relational storage systems that can process large quantities of complex data in real time. Cloud service providers such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google each have popular cloud data warehousing products that can meet requirements and provide business solutions to warehouse and analyze their data. Cloud Data Warehousing provides distributed scalable non relational storage systems that can process large quantities of complex data, in real time. With cloud-based data warehousing, companies are not constrained by physical data centers and can dynamically scale storage resources to meet changing business budgets and requirements. In addition, the cloud offers the advantages of flexibility, collaboration and availability from anywhere. Moving from a traditional warehousing solution to a cloud based solution, allows companies to dynamically scale up or down data warehouse capacity, without upfront capital investments or time consuming infrastructure deployment.
