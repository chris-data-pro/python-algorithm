3.2.5 The Machine Learning Process
Developing a machine learning solution is seldom a linear process. Several trial-and-error steps are necessary to fine-tune the solution. The details of each step performed by the Data Crunchers data scientists as they work on the new weed identification and eradication model are as follows:Step 1. Data preparation - Perform data cleaning procedures such as transformation into a structured format and removing missing data and noisy/corrupted observations.   Step 2a. Learning data - Create a learning data set used to train the model. Step 2b. Testing data - Create a test dataset used to evaluate the model performance. Only perform this step in the case of supervised learning.   Step 3. Learning Process Loop - Selection. An algorithm is chosen based on the problem. Depending on the selected algorithm, additional pre-processing steps might be necessary.Step 4. Learning Process Loop - Evaluation. This selected algorithm's performance is evaluated on the learning data. If the algorithm and the model reach an acceptable performance on learning data, the solution validates the test data. Otherwise, repeat the learning process with a proposed new model and algorithm.Step 5. Model evaluation - Test the solution on the test data. The performances on learning data are not necessarily transferrable to test data. The more complex and fine-tuned the model is, the higher the chances are that the model will become prone to overfitting, which means it cannot perform accurately against unseen data. Overfitting can result in going back to the model learning process.   Step 6. Model implementation - After the model achieves satisfactory performance on test data, implement the model. Implementing the model means performing the necessary tasks to scale the machine learning solution to big data.

3.2.7 Training Machines to Recognize Patterns
3.2.7 Training Machines to Recognize Patterns
Earlier, you learned that machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. Artificial Intelligence is the concept that a system can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with little or no human intervention. Machine learning has many valuable applications in the field of data analytics. One critical application is pattern recognition.Pattern recognition utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in digital data. These patterns are then applied to different datasets with the goal of recognizing the same or similar patterns in the new data. The data can be contained in many different formats, such as text, photographs, or videos. For example, if referencing classes of birds, a description of a bird would be a pattern. The types could be sparrows, robins, or finch, among others. Using computer vision, image processing technologies, and pattern recognition, we can extract specific patterns from images of birds in this example and compare them to pictures of birds stored in a database.Pattern recognition uses the concept of learning to classify data based on statistical information gained from patterns and their representations. Learning enables the pattern recognition systems to be "trained" and adaptable to provide more accurate results. When training the pattern recognition system, a portion of the dataset prepares the system, and the remaining amount tests the system's accuracy. As shown in the figure below, the data set divides into two groups: train the model and test the model. The training data set is used to build the model and consists of about 80% of the data. It contains the set of images used to train the system. The testing data set consists of about 20% of the data and measures the model's accuracy. For example, if the system that identifies categories of birds can correctly identify seven out of ten birds, then the system's accuracy is 70%.
