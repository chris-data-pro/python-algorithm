Video Title: Popular Conceptions of Artifical Intelligence
Video URL: 
 At Data Crunchers, there are a few projects that are garnering a lot of attention from both our employees and clients. These projects are among our first that involve artificial intelligence, robots, and machine learning, the stuff that used to be only in science-fiction movies. One project that we're working on involves gathering data from images and GPS information. This will be used to train a robot to use AI-enabled recognition, to differentiate between weeds and crops, to reduce the use of chemical herbicides. That may not sound like a big project, but it requires a significant amount of unstructured data in the form of images and video that must be analyzed throughout the machine learning process.
