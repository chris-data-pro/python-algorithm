Video Title: Discrete vs Continuous Data
Video URL: 
 Data analysis begins with understanding the types of data you're working with. Data can first be defined as quantitative or qualitative. Qualitative data is descriptive. It is typically represented as text, is non-numerical in nature, and is collected through surveys, questionnaires, interviews, or observations. An example of qualitative data is the reviews that are collected about various products on a shopping site. Quantitative data is numerical in nature. You are trying to quantify information. (upbeat music) Quantitative data can further be broken down into discrete and continuous data. Discrete data can only take on certain values, typically whole numbers. Examples of discrete data include account of transactions processed in a day or the number of people who visit a website each week. Continuous data is measured and can be represented in an infinite number of ways. An example of continuous data could be the average distance traveled by a moving car, which is constantly being updated as the car moves forward. Understanding quantitative versus qualitative data is an initial step, but strong familiarity with all types of data is necessary if you're going to be a versatile analyst. (upbeat music)
