Video Title: What is ML and AI
Video URL: 
 AI and machine learning are helping businesses make faster, better decisions, from helping us find potential cures for cancer, to better securing our financial transactions, to making autonomous vehicles safer and more. Why is this happening now at scale? Because processing and storage are rapidly becoming faster and cheaper, algorithms are smarter, and the AI ecosystem is larger. Let's take a closer look at an autonomous driving example to see the impact. There are several key stages in an AI and machine learning project. First, data is collected and prepared by data scientists. Then, training is performed to teach the required skills. And finally, inference is performed to make decisions based on new data. The value of AI is enormous, but there are challenges. For example, data preparation is very time-consuming, requiring up to 80% of data scientists' efforts. And data is often located across many sources. Data volumes are huge and growing fast, and that data is often sensitive or regulated, requiring workloads to be deployed on premises. Data volume and velocity create challenges across all stages, requiring high-performance systems that are adaptable to power these workloads at scale.
