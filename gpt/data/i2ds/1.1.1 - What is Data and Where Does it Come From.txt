Video Title: What is Data and Where Does it Come From
Video URL: 
 Through your daily activities, you generate a great amount of data that can be volunteered, observed, or inferred. You volunteer data by filling out forms, posting photos and videos on social media, or consenting to website policies. Organizations also collect data about you through observations such as your location, stores you frequent, and websites you visit. Your personal style, likes and dislikes, and behavioral habits can even be inferred from your actions. By itself all this data can be rather meaningless; however, that changes immediately once you apply data analytics to your data. The process of taking data from its raw state and using it to inform useful actions is the realm of data analytics. Through the power of analytics, organizations can use your volunteered, observe, or inferred data to provide you with a personalized experience. (light music)
