Video Title: The Importance of a Project Portfolio
Video URL: 
 One of the most common ways to showcase your analytic skills is to create and share a project portfolio. Portfolios are collections of examples of your work. The work that you showcase in a portfolio can be projects that you have done during your education, projects that you undertake using topics and data that you're interested in researching, or ones that are related to your current employment. The purpose of the portfolio is to expand upon the information that you provide in your resume, CV, or cover letter. The portfolio gives future employers insights into your interests and abilities. In addition to demonstrating your skills, employers are often interested in other information about you. Adding a blog to your portfolio gives you an opportunity to share how you became interested in pursuing a career as a data professional, topics, and projects that you want to pursue, and any competitions that you enter or win.
