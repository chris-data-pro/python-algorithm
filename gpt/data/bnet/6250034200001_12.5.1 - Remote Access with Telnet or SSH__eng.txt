Video Title: Remote Access with Telnet or SSH__eng
Video URL: 
 - In this video we're going to demonstrate how to access a server remotely using either Telnet or SSH. So here I've brought up some software known as Tera Term, which allows me to use Telnet or SSH. Telnet and SSH allows me to remotely access a server, another device, as if I was actually sitting at that device. I'm going to use SSH, which is a more secure version of Telnet. So in the Host name I have oslab.cis.cabrillo.edu. This can either be a host name or an IP address. This is the name of a server that I have at school, Cabrillo College, where I happen to teach. So at this point I have SSH selected. I'm just going to click on OK. It asks me for a username and password. So I put in my username, rick, and I'm going to put in the password. Click on OK. So as you can see, I have remotely connected to the server Opus, which is one of the servers we have at my school, Cabrillo College. So it is as if I am sitting at that computer itself, typing in the commands. But instead I'm miles away, remotely accessing it.
