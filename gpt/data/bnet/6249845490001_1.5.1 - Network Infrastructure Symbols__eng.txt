 - In this video, we're going to take a look at some of the symbols you're going to see throughout the course to represent various types of networking equipment. In this first screen, we see some of the examples of intermediate devices. Some of these you may recognize from your own network, such as a router, a wireless router, a switch, and a wireless access point. Here are some examples of end devices, such as a laptop, printer, smartphone, an IP phone, and this is examples of the symbols that we'll be using for network media, such as LAN media, Local Area Network, most commonly an Ethernet LAN. WAN media, Wide Area Network media, that's commonly used for internet service provider communications, wireless media, and the Cloud, which is used to represent another network or the internet. So you'll see these symbols used throughout this course and other courses.
