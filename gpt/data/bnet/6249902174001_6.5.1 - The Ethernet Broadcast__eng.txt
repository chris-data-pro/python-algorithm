Video Title: The Ethernet Broadcast__eng
Video URL: 
 - In this video, we're going to take a look at an Ethernet broadcast. An Ethernet broadcast is when the destination MAC address is 48 one-bits, or in hexidecimal, all Fs. So looking at the animation here, we have H1 going to send a broadcast to all the other devices. This might be a message that it needs all the devices in its network to receive. So we can see H1 sends the broadcast. When a switch receives an Ethernet broadcast, it floods, or forwards, the Ethernet frame out all ports except the incoming port. The result is, all the devices in the network will receive the broadcast. If we have a router in the network, it will receive the broadcast also. However, the router will not forward the broadcast on to other networks.
