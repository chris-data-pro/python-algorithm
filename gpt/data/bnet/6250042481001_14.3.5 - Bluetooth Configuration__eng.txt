 - [Man] Hello, everyone. You want to get some Bluetooth connectivity going here with our computer. Now, to do this there's a couple of ways to go about it. There's really, like, three common ways we can go. Now, it depends on your Windows operating system, but here in Windows 10, the first thing I can do is click on my Action Center on the bottom right corner, and I can make sure that my Bluetooth is even on, which is in Bluetooth and not connected. I can click on that to turn off Bluetooth, or again, I can click on it to turn it on. I can even right click on it, and click on Go to Settings, and that's going to take me to my Bluetooth settings immediately, which is great. But let's go two other methods. What I can do in Windows, is I can click on the Start button, and I can go to the Control Panel, and in the Control Panel I can go to Add a device, which is inside of Hardware and Sound, and I can add a device, including Bluetooth, that way. Another way I can do it, is I can go to Start, then I can type in settings, then I can click on Settings. Inside of Settings, I can go to Devices, and in Devices, we'll be here at the Bluetooth settings. Whichever way you prefer, there's multiple ways to get to the same destination. At this point, what I want to do is add a Bluetooth device. So we're going to pause here, and I want to turn on my Bluetooth headset. So I've got my Bluetooth headset, and every model will be a little bit different, we're not here to do a video on a Bluetooth headset, but in general, this is the Bluetooth device I'm going to connect. So, after researching my device and pulling up the manufacturer's manual for this, I need to put this headset into pairing mode. In pairing mode, it will be able to connect with our computer. So I have the power button here and there's an indicator light, I can press and hold that power button, and according to my manual, when the light starts flashing red and blue alternating, then it's in pairing mode. There we go, it's red and blue, now it's in pairing mode and we can continue by adding it to our computer. Okay, so to continue, the Bluetooth headset is on, and it's going to be in a pairing mode, what I need to do now is click Add Bluetooth or other device. When I click on that, it wants to know what type of device I'm going to be adding on, I'm going to click on Bluetooth, because it's going to be an audio device for a headset. So it's looking for the devices, here it finds some. This is the headset that I have connected, I want to hook up via Bluetooth. I can click on that audio headset, and it's going to connect to it and pair with that headset. The device is ready to go, it says we're connected with voice and music for my headset wirelessly using Bluetooth with my computer. I'll click on done, and we can even verify this by going back to our Action Center, here, in Windows 10, and we can see Bluetooth and the name of the device that's connected. When I'm done for the day, I can always turn off my Bluetooth adapter, which will disconnect it from my headset. Also, in the future, if I turn on my Bluetooth on my computer, if that headset is nearby, it should be able to connect back to it automatically. And there it is, Bluetooth is on, and the headset is connected again.
