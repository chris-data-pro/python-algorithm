Video Title: FTP Client Software__eng

 - So here we're going to demonstrate how to use an FTP client software. FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. It allows us to easily copy files from one device to another, from a client device to a server or from the server back to the client. A lot of times this is used when uploading your webpage information to a web server. So let's take a look. Here in FileZilla where it says Host, I'm going to type in ftp.cdc.gov. This happens to be a available ftp server that anybody can use. And the Username is going to be anonymous. And there's no password associated with this site. Typically, you're going to have a username and password that's associated with the web server so you can upload and download the information securely. Okay, I'm going to click on Quick Connect. And now we're connected to this FTP Server. On the left here is my desktop or the files from my computer. On the right is the remote site. Let me show you how easy it is to transfer a file, in this case, from the remote site, the ftp.cdc.gov server to my local host. So I'm going to go down here and here we have a welcome message, and I'm just going to drag that over to my desktop, and that's all there is to it. It just copied it from the remote server to my local desktop. And we can actually see that welcome message right here. And there we go. There's the file that we had just downloaded from ftp.cdc.gov.
