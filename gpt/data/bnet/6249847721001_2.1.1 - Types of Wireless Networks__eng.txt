Video Title: Types of Wireless Networks__eng

 - Our cell phones communicate on many different networks. When we're communicating over the voice channel, and we're talking say to someone on another cell phone, our communications are going through the cellular provider network. When we use a bluetooth device like a speaker or a headset or even a smart watch, that device is communicating through a completely different network. It is a much shorter range wireless network than the cellular network, and it works with different rules and different protocols. Wi-Fi is something you are probably the most familiar because Wi-Fi is supported on many different types of devices, including smartphones. When we are working on a Wi-Fi network we are usually using that network to communicate over the global internet. And lastly we have near field communications. Near field communications allow us to send information over an extremely short distance. This is how you might use your cellphone to pay for something, you know, in a grocery store or a fast food restaurant. Basically all of these communications, protocols, rules and frequencies are contained within the same device. As far as I'm concerned it's pretty amazing. Now there is one other thing that your cellphone does, and that is, it is capable of receiving GPS signals. What's happening is your cellphone is actually receiving signals from satellites that are stationed all around the Earth. And they send signals down to the various devices that have GPS capability. And when they do, your cellphone is able to figure out where it is, usually within a few meters. All of these things may actually be happening simultaneously.
