Video Title: Dividing the Local Network__eng
Video URL: 
 - In this lesson, we're going to talk about how as networks grow, it becomes necessary to begin to divide them from a single large local network to multiple smaller local network segments. Let's look at our enterprise here that we had drawn on the board. And this enterprise consists of three major departments. We have Network Management. We have the Accounting Department. And we have the Sales Department. Now some of the reasons that you might divide a network into smaller components. The first one is just to limit the amount of broadcast traffic that goes across the network. Anytime you generate a broadcast, even though I'm way over here in Network Management, my computer and all of the other devices on the network will be forced to accept that broadcast and process it. Most broadcasts don't contain information that every single device needs to know. So there are a lot of broadcasts that are being processed by your device that are eventually being thrown away because the information contained in that broadcast really isn't needed by any application on your device. Now, that's one reason that we might want to divide a network is to contain broadcasts, to make smaller broadcast domains. And the term broadcast domain refers to the area that hears a broadcast, so in the case of this network, because all of the devices are connected by switches, all the broadcasts would be heard by all of the connected devices. Now, another reason that why we might want to divide our network is for security purposes. We may not want people in the Sales Department to be able to see the devices and servers or use the printers that are located in the Accounting Department. We might also not want the Accounting Department to be able to access the network control mechanisms that are in the Network Management Department. So that's another reason why we might want to divide our network into smaller pieces. A major reason that we might want to divide the network is say, for example, our Accounting Department is moving. They've got a new building or a new office on a different floor and they're going to be moving outside of where our local network can actually service them. So taking and dividing something by geographical location requires us to make our network segments much smaller. So basically, how do we do that? How do we divide a network that is one large network into smaller pieces? One of the ways we do is with a router. In all networks, the local network, meaning the network that belongs to the business, or the home, or the enterprise, that network is separated from the internet by a router. When you buy your home network connection, your service provider puts a router at your home. That is so that the traffic that is generated by your network does not end up at the internet. The internet would not be happy with that. So basically, when we add a router, the router enables us to divide the network and also to divide the broadcast domains. So if I were to insert routers into this network diagram, let me draw some routers here. When I insert routers into this diagram, I have now taken one relatively large network and divided it to three separate networks. On a router, every interface on a router connects to and defines a separate network. And when I'm talking about separate networks we're talking about both broadcast domains, but also different IP networks, different networks that have different sets of IP addresses that identify all of the people within the network as being on the same IP network. So basically, to recap the reasons that we divide a network. We divide the network because of security. We divide the network because we want to maintain smaller broadcast domains. And we divide the network because we may be moving things to different locations where a single large network can't reach.

Timestamp: 00:01:10.425 - 00:01:14.215 Text: So there are a lot of broadcasts
that are being processed
Timestamp: 00:01:14.215 - 00:01:17.282 Text: by your device that are
eventually being thrown away
Timestamp: 00:01:17.282 - 00:01:19.828 Text: because the information
contained in that broadcast
Timestamp: 00:01:19.828 - 00:01:22.205 Text: really isn't needed by any application

Timestamp: 00:01:29.470 - 00:01:31.453 Text: is to contain broadcasts,

Timestamp: 00:01:34.694 - 00:01:38.000 Text: And the term broadcast
domain refers to the area
Timestamp: 00:01:38.000 - 00:01:40.307 Text: that hears a broadcast,
Timestamp: 00:01:40.307 - 00:01:42.321 Text: so in the case of this network,
Timestamp: 00:01:42.321 - 00:01:44.080 Text: because all of the devices
Timestamp: 00:01:44.080 - 00:01:45.885 Text: are connected by switches,
Timestamp: 00:01:45.885 - 00:01:48.021 Text: all the broadcasts would be heard

Timestamp: 00:01:50.988 - 00:01:52.946 Text: Now, another reason that why we might
Timestamp: 00:01:52.946 - 00:01:56.662 Text: want to divide our network
is for security purposes.
Timestamp: 00:01:56.662 - 00:02:00.345 Text: We may not want people
in the Sales Department
Timestamp: 00:02:00.345 - 00:02:03.861 Text: to be able to see the devices and servers
Timestamp: 00:02:03.861 - 00:02:05.923 Text: or use the printers that are located
Timestamp: 00:02:05.923 - 00:02:08.059 Text: in the Accounting Department.
Timestamp: 00:02:08.059 - 00:02:10.815 Text: We might also not want
the Accounting Department
Timestamp: 00:02:10.815 - 00:02:14.674 Text: to be able to access the
network control mechanisms
Timestamp: 00:02:14.674 - 00:02:17.524 Text: that are in the Network
Management Department.
Timestamp: 00:02:17.524 - 00:02:19.300 Text: So that's another reason why we
Timestamp: 00:02:19.300 - 00:02:24.257 Text: might want to divide our
network into smaller pieces.
Timestamp: 00:02:24.257 - 00:02:27.954 Text: A major reason that we might
want to divide the network
Timestamp: 00:02:27.954 - 00:02:32.115 Text: is say, for example, our
Accounting Department is moving.
Timestamp: 00:02:32.115 - 00:02:34.445 Text: They've got a new building or a new office

Timestamp: 00:02:39.347 - 00:02:42.746 Text: of where our local network
can actually service them.
Timestamp: 00:02:42.746 - 00:02:47.486 Text: So taking and dividing something
by geographical location
Timestamp: 00:02:47.486 - 00:02:49.403 Text: requires us to make our
Timestamp: 00:02:50.415 - 00:02:52.915 Text: network segments much smaller.
Timestamp: 00:02:54.661 - 00:02:57.017 Text: So basically, how do we do that?
Timestamp: 00:02:57.017 - 00:02:58.947 Text: How do we divide a network
Timestamp: 00:02:58.947 - 00:03:01.065 Text: that is one large network
Timestamp: 00:03:01.065 - 00:03:02.732 Text: into smaller pieces?
Timestamp: 00:03:04.001 - 00:03:07.185 Text: One of the ways we do is with a router.
Timestamp: 00:03:07.185 - 00:03:08.518 Text: In all networks,
Timestamp: 00:03:10.860 - 00:03:12.552 Text: the local network,
Timestamp: 00:03:12.552 - 00:03:14.650 Text: meaning the network that
belongs to the business,
Timestamp: 00:03:14.650 - 00:03:17.233 Text: or the home, or the enterprise,
Timestamp: 00:03:18.308 - 00:03:22.432 Text: that network is separated
from the internet
Timestamp: 00:03:22.432 - 00:03:24.150 Text: by a router.
Timestamp: 00:03:24.150 - 00:03:26.488 Text: When you buy your home network connection,
Timestamp: 00:03:26.488 - 00:03:30.374 Text: your service provider puts
a router at your home.
Timestamp: 00:03:30.374 - 00:03:32.606 Text: That is so that the
traffic that is generated
Timestamp: 00:03:32.606 - 00:03:37.181 Text: by your network does not
end up at the internet.
Timestamp: 00:03:37.181 - 00:03:39.906 Text: The internet would not be happy with that.
Timestamp: 00:03:39.906 - 00:03:40.989 Text: So basically,
Timestamp: 00:03:42.156 - 00:03:44.352 Text: when we add a router,
Timestamp: 00:03:44.352 - 00:03:47.335 Text: the router enables us
to divide the network
Timestamp: 00:03:47.335 - 00:03:51.535 Text: and also to divide the broadcast domains.
Timestamp: 00:03:51.535 - 00:03:54.035 Text: So if I were to insert routers
Timestamp: 00:03:55.998 - 00:03:58.165 Text: into this network diagram,
Timestamp: 00:03:59.523 - 00:04:02.023 Text: let me draw some routers here.
Timestamp: 00:04:08.130 - 00:04:10.715 Text: When I insert routers into this diagram,
Timestamp: 00:04:10.715 - 00:04:14.372 Text: I have now taken one
relatively large network
Timestamp: 00:04:14.372 - 00:04:17.872 Text: and divided it to three separate networks.
Timestamp: 00:04:19.055 - 00:04:19.939 Text: On a router,
Timestamp: 00:04:19.939 - 00:04:22.731 Text: every interface on a router
Timestamp: 00:04:22.731 - 00:04:26.723 Text: connects to and defines
a separate network.
Timestamp: 00:04:26.723 - 00:04:28.517 Text: And when I'm talking
about separate networks
Timestamp: 00:04:28.517 - 00:04:31.633 Text: we're talking about
both broadcast domains,
Timestamp: 00:04:31.633 - 00:04:34.216 Text: but also different IP networks,
Timestamp: 00:04:35.083 - 00:04:37.181 Text: different networks that have different
Timestamp: 00:04:37.181 - 00:04:41.075 Text: sets of IP addresses that
identify all of the people
Timestamp: 00:04:41.075 - 00:04:43.157 Text: within the network as being
Timestamp: 00:04:43.157 - 00:04:45.074 Text: on the same IP network.
Timestamp: 00:04:47.395 - 00:04:51.562 Text: So basically, to recap the
reasons that we divide a network.
Timestamp: 00:04:52.897 - 00:04:55.719 Text: We divide the network because of security.
Timestamp: 00:04:55.719 - 00:04:57.370 Text: We divide the network because we want
Timestamp: 00:04:57.370 - 00:05:00.714 Text: to maintain smaller broadcast domains.
Timestamp: 00:05:00.714 - 00:05:03.507 Text: And we divide the network because we may
Timestamp: 00:05:03.507 - 00:05:06.243 Text: be moving things to different locations
Timestamp: 00:05:06.243 - 00:05:09.660 Text: where a single large network can't reach.
