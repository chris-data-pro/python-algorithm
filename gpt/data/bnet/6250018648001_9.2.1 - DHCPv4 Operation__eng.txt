 - Hi, in this lesson we're going to talk about how DHCP works. Earlier, you learned that IP address assignments can be given out in two ways, statically, meaning that someone actually sits down and configures the IP address, or dynamically, where the device gets its address from a DHCP server. DHCP means the protocol that is being used to obtain that IP address. DHCP stands for dynamic host configuration protocol. So how does that protocol work? The protocol describes a set of messages that go between the host wanting an IP address and the DHCP server that gives out the IP address. So basically what we have is, we have a host system that sends out a packet called a DHCP discover. And what this packet is doing is actually looking for a DHCP server. The packet is a broadcast packet, and it contains the MAC address of the device requesting the IP address and it is destined for any device on the network that's configured to be a DHCP server. What kind of devices can be DHCP servers? Typically, in a home network, the home router, the wireless router or the wired router, is configured to give out DHCP. In larger environments, often this is a server that would be doing other functions, like Microsoft domain controlling, or it might be a LINUX server that also doubles as a web server. So basically, the DHCP server can be a number of different types of devices. So when the DHCP discover goes out, since it is a broadcast, any DHCP server attached to the network will hear that. The DHCP server then responds with a DHCP offer. The DHCP offer packet contains an IP address that the host, the individual device, could use, if it accepts it. When the host receives the DHCP offer packet from the DHCP server containing the IP address, and here's the IP address that was sent, and the subnet mask, as well as the default gateway address. Once the host receives that, it sends back a DHCP request packet that it will accept the offer. And it will request the IP address that the server had sent it, 192.168.1.15. The device will then take this information and enter it into its IP address settings. And at that time, once the server receives the DHCP request, the server will send back a DHCP acknowledgement that will indicate to the host that the server is placing this IP address into its table associated with the MAC address that was sent from the host.
