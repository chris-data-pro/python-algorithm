Video Title: Throughput__eng
Video URL: 
 - Hi. In this video, we're going to demonstrate throughput using the website speedtest.net. There are other websites that do a similar sort of thing. So throughput. Throughput is the amount of data sent and received over a connection, including any delays that might occur. This includes delays in both directions. It can happen, delays sending the messages there, or receiving the messages. So let's go ahead and take a look using speedtest.net. We're going to go ahead and click on Begin Test. And as we can see that we're going to be downloading some messages. So you see the download speed. This is the number of bits per second that is being received. And as we're going to see in a moment, this is the millions of bits per second, known as megabits per second. So we see the download speed, or the bandwidth, is 35.70 megabits per second, millions of bits per second. The upload speed, or the upload bandwidth, that measures at 35.04 megabits per second. 35.04 millions of bits per second. Okay, we can see that our download speed is slightly higher, in this case, than our upload speed. Typically at home, you're going to experience that you're going to be able to receive data, receive messages, faster, higher download speed, than you are going to be able to upload. So here we've used www.speedtest.net. There are other sites as well. These are always a good tool to help measure the performance, the amount of data you can send and receive, not just over your network, but also through your internet service provider, your internet connection.
