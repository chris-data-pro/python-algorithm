14.0.1 Webster - Why Should I Take this Module?
Kishori leaves work for the day and begins her drive home. Her friend has called her to warn her that there is a lot of congestion on her usual route home. She used the GPS on her phone to reroute to a less congested road. Kishori wonders if networks can get congested. Do they find a faster route?Great question Kishori! Networks can also have this issue of congestion slowing down its performance. In a network, the router can determine the best path. How does a network become congested? What can you do to limit that congestion? You and Kishori will find out in this module!

14.1.2 Now We Need Routing
In most situations we want our devices to be able to connect beyond our local network: out to other homes, businesses, and the internet. Devices that are beyond the local network segment are known as remote hosts. When a source device sends a packet to a remote destination device, then the help of routers and routing is needed. Routing is the process of identifying the best path to a destination.A router is a networking device that connects multiple Layer 3, IP networks. At the distribution layer of the network, routers direct traffic and perform other functions critical to efficient network operation. Routers, like switches, are able to decode and read the messages that are sent to them. Unlike switches, which make their forwarding decision based on the Layer 2 MAC address, routers make their forwarding decision based on the Layer 3 IP address.The packet format contains the IP addresses of the destination and source hosts, as well as the message data being sent between them. The router reads the network portion of the destination IP address and uses it to find which one of the attached networks is the best way to forward the message to the destination.Anytime the network portion of the IP addresses of the source and destination hosts do not match, a router must be used to forward the message. If a host located on network 1.1.1.0 needs to send a message to a host on network 5.5.5.0, the host will forward the message to the router. The router receives the message, de-encapsulates the Ethernet frame, and then reads the destination IP address in the IP packet. It then determines where to forward the message. It re-encapsulates the packet back into a new frame, and forwards the frame on to its destination.Click Play to see how the MAC and IP addresses are used.IP Packet Encapsulated in an Ethernet Frame

14.2.4 Routing Table Entries
Routers move information between local and remote networks. To do this, routers must use routing tables to store information. Routing tables are not concerned with the addresses of individual hosts. Routing tables contain the addresses of networks, and the best path to reach those networks. Entries can be made to the routing table in two ways: dynamically updated by information received from other routers in the network, or manually entered by a network administrator. Routers use the routing tables to determine which interface to use to forward a message to its intended destination. If the router cannot determine where to forward a message, it will drop it. Network administrators configure a static default route that is placed into the routing table so that a packet will not be dropped due to the destination network not being in the routing table. A default route is the interface through which the router forwards a packet containing an unknown destination IP network address. This default route usually connects to another router that can forward the packet towards its final destination network.



Type - The connection type. C stands for directly connected.Network - The network address.Port - The interface used to forward packets to the network.
14.2.5 The Default Gateway
The method that a host uses to send messages to a destination on a remote network differs from the way a host sends messages on the same local network. When a host needs to send a message to another host located on the same network, it will forward the message directly. A host will use ARP to discover the MAC address of the destination host. The IPv4 packet contains the destination IPv4 address and encapsulates the packet into a frame containing the MAC address of the destination and forwards it out. When a host needs to send a message to a remote network, it must use the router. The host includes the IP address of the destination host within the packet just like before. However, when it encapsulates the packet into a frame, it uses the MAC address of the router as the destination for the frame. In this way, the router will receive and accept the frame based on the MAC address. How does the source host determine the MAC address of the router? A host is given the IPv4 address of the router through the default gateway address configured in its TCP/IP settings. The default gateway address is the address of the router interface connected to the same local network as the source host. All hosts on the local network use the default gateway address to send messages to the router. When the host knows the default gateway IPv4 address, it can use ARP to determine the MAC address. The MAC address of the router is then placed in the frame, destined for another network. It is important that the correct default gateway be configured on each host on the local network. If no default gateway is configured in the host TCP/IP settings, or if the wrong default gateway is specified, messages addressed to hosts on remote networks cannot be delivered.

14.3.1 Local Area Networks
The term local area network (LAN) refers to a local network, or a group of interconnected local networks that are under the same administrative control. In the early days of networking, LANs were defined as small networks that existed in a single physical location. Although LANs can be a single local network installed in a home or small office, the definition of LAN has evolved to include interconnected local networks consisting of many hundreds of hosts, installed in multiple buildings and locations. The important thing to remember is that all the local networks within a LAN are under one administrative control. Other common characteristics of LANs are that they typically use Ethernet or wireless protocols, and they support high data rates. The term intranet is often used to refer to a private LAN that belongs to an organization, and is designed to be accessible only by the members of the organization, employees, or others with authorization.
14.3.2 Local and Remote Network Segments
Within a LAN, it is possible to place all hosts on a single local network or divide them up between multiple networks connected by a distribution layer device. How this placement is determined depends on desired results.Click below to learn more about local and remote network segments.
