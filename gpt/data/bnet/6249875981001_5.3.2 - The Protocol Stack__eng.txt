Video Title: The Protocol Stack__eng
Video URL: 
 - Successful communications requires the use of several protocols. So when a device sends a message, it is actually using several protocols. So here we have what is known as a, "Protocol Stack". In this example here I am showing the TCP/IP Model, which has different layers; The Network Access layer, Internet layer, Transport layer, and the Application layer. So when a device creates a message, it is actually using protocols from these different layers. For example, this message over here. It is utilizing at the Network Access layer, the Ethernet protocol. The Ethernet protocol is used for NIC card, network interface card to network interface card communications in the same network. The next protocol that's used, is an Internet layer protocol, IP. This can be IP version 4 or IP version 6. This makes sure that the message gets from the original source to the final destination. Whether or not that message is within the same network or has to go across multiple networks. Another protocol that's used is, a protocol from the Transport layer. In this example, we're using TCP, transmission control protocol. This makes sure that the information, the message, gets there reliably. Then the last protocol is from the Application layer. This case, HTTP. HTTP governs the exchange or transfer of HTML. So as you can see, sending a message requires the use of multiple protocols from the Protocol Stack.
