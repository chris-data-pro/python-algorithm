Video Title: HTTP and HTML__eng
Video URL: 
 - In this video, we're going to take a look at HTTP and HTML. HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. These are the rules that govern how the information is transmitted between the client, the device asking for the webpage, and the web server that sends the webpage back to the client. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. This is the coding, the information, that actually is used to display the webpage itself. Let's take a look. So we're going to start with the client asking for the webpage www.cisco.com, but like we said previously, the network, the internet, doesn't understand names, doesn't understand domain names. It needs the IP address associated with www.cisco.com. So the user, the system, is going to contact the DNS server. The DNS server is going to associate the domain name, www.cisco.com, with an IP address, and return that IP address to the user, to the system. Now the system can contact the web server, www.cisco.com, using this IP address. This request uses HTTP to request the webpage. It is sent to the web server, www.cisco.com, that uses HTTP to return the information, the HTML code, back to the user. Now the user can display the webpage www.cisco.com in its browser. So here we can see the www.cisco.com webpage. To take a look at the HTML code, we just go right over here to the menu, Developer. Click on page source. This page source, this is the actual HTML code. This HTML code was downloaded from the web server www.cisco.com to the client's system and displayed in its browser. The browser then takes this code, displays it, and we see the webpage www.cisco.com.
