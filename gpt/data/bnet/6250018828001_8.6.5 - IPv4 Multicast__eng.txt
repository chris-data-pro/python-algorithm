Video Title: IPv4 Multicast__eng

 - Multicast transmission is used to send a packet from a single device to a selected group of devices. IPv4 multicast addresses have a range from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255. So in this animation here, we're going to have a multicast transmission going from 172.16.4.1 to two selected hosts that are a member of the multicast group. But, the only two devices that this packet is for, is for 172.16.4.3 and 172.16.4.4. So we can see here that the packet leaves 172.16.4.1 and is received by multiple devices on the network. However, only 4.3 and 4.4 are the only two devices that are a member of the multicast group. So they're the only two devices that will actually process this packet.
