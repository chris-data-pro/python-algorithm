4.0.1 Webster - Why Should I Take this Module?
Kishori and Shridhar are washing the dishes after dinner. Kishori is watching a favorite movie on her tablet while putting the dishes away. She asks Shridhar if her tablet works exactly as her mobile phone does. He explains that there are some tablets that do use a mobile network, but that her tablet is works on Wi-Fi network in her house. She tells him that she knows it must come in from that box in the corner of the living room. That is all she knows!Shridhar explains that the box in the corner is a home router. The router is connected to the internet. Home routers typically have two primary types of ports: ethernet ports and internet ports. In addition to the wired ports, many home routers include a radio antenna and a built-in wireless access point. Kishori mostly uses wireless at home. Now Shridhar is worried about his mother’s wireless security. Since she did not know what the router was, she probably did not change her default password on the router! Shridhar logs into the router and makes some changes to keep Kishori’s network and devices safer.Have you ever set up a router? Have you thought about having secure communications over wireless devices? This module will give you the knowledge to build a home network and configure wireless devices for secure communication.

Here are a few examples:Desktop computersGaming systemsSmart TV systemsPrintersScannersSecurity camerasTelephonesClimate control devicesAs the new technologies come on the market, more and more household functions will rely on the network to provide connectivity and control.Home Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)


4.1.3 Typical Home Network Routers
Small business and home routers typically have two primary types of ports:

In addition to the wired ports, many home routers include a radio antenna and a built-in wireless access point. By default, the wireless devices are on the same local network as the devices that are physically plugged into the LAN switch ports. The internet port is the only port that is on a different network in the default configuration.

4.2.1 LAN Wireless Frequencies
The wireless technologies most frequently used in home networks are in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency ranges.Bluetooth is a technology that makes use of the 2.4 GHz band. It is limited to low-speed, short-range communications, but has the advantage of communicating with many devices at the same time. This one-to-many communication has made Bluetooth technology the preferred method for connecting computer peripherals such as wireless mice, keyboards and printers. Bluetooth is a good method for transmitting audio to speakers or headphones.Other technologies that use the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands are the modern wireless LAN technologies that conform to the various IEEE 802.11 standards. Unlike Bluetooth technology, 802.11 devices transmit at a much higher power level giving them a great range and improved throughput. Certain areas of the electromagnetic spectrum can be used without a permit.

The figure shows where wireless technologies exist on the electromagnetic spectrum.
4.2.2 Wired Network Technologies
Although many home network devices support wireless communications, there are still a few applications where devices benefit from a wired switch connection that is not shared with other users on the network.The most commonly implemented wired protocol is the Ethernet protocol. Ethernet uses a suite of protocols that allow network devices to communicate over a wired LAN connection. An Ethernet LAN can connect devices using many different types of wiring media.Directly connected devices use an Ethernet patch cable, usually unshielded twisted pair. These cables can be purchased with the RJ-45 connectors already installed, and they come in various lengths. Recently constructed homes may have Ethernet jacks already wired in the walls of the home. For those homes that do not have UTP wiring, there are other technologies, such as powerline, that can distribute wired connectivity throughout the premises.Click each wired technology for more information.

4.3.1 Wi-Fi Networks
A number of standards have been developed to ensure that wireless devices can communicate. They specify the RF spectrum used, data rates, how the information is transmitted, and more. The main organization responsible for the creation of wireless technical standards is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The IEEE 802.11 standard governs the WLAN environment. There are amendments to the IEEE 802.11 standard that describe characteristics for different standards of wireless communications. Wireless standards for LANs use the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands. Collectively these technologies are referred to as Wi-Fi. Another organization, known as the Wi-Fi Alliance, is responsible for testing wireless LAN devices from different manufacturers. The Wi-Fi logo on a device means that this equipment meets standards and should operate with other devices that use the same standard. Wireless standards are constantly improving the connectivity and speed of Wi-Fi networks. It is important to be aware of new standards as they are introduced because manufacturers of wireless devices will implement these standards quickly in their new products. Do you have a wireless network in your home? Do you know what standards are supported by your wireless router?
4.3.2 Wireless Settings
The Packet Tracer Basic Wireless Settings interface is shown in the figure. Wireless routers using the 802.11 standards have multiple settings that have to be configured. These settings include the following:



Network Mode The 802.11 protocol can provide increased throughput based on the wireless network environment. If all wireless devices connect with the same 802.11 standard, maximum speeds can be obtained for that standard. If the access point is configured to accept only one 802.11 standard, devices that do not use that standard cannot connect to the access point. A mixed mode wireless network environment can include devices that use any of the existing Wi-Fi standards. This environment provides easy access for older devices that need a wireless connection but do not support the latest standards. When building a wireless network, it is important that the wireless components connect to the appropriate WLAN. This is done using the SSID. The SSID is a case-sensitive, alphanumeric string that contains up to 32 characters. It is sent in the header of all frames transmitted over the WLAN. The SSID is used to tell wireless devices, called wireless stations (STAs), which WLAN they belong to and with which other devices they can communicate. We use the SSID to identify a specific wireless network. It is essentially the name of the network. Wireless routers usually broadcast their configured SSIDs by default. The SSID broadcast allows other devices and wireless clients to automatically discover the name of the wireless network. When the SSID broadcast is disabled, you must manually enter the SSID on wireless devices. Disabling SSID broadcasting can make it more difficult for legitimate clients to find the wireless network. However, simply turning off the SSID broadcast is not sufficient to prevent unauthorized clients from connecting to the wireless network. All wireless networks should use the strongest available encryption to restrict unauthorized access.

4.4.1 First Time Setup
Many wireless routers designed for home use have an automatic setup utility that can be used to configure the basic settings on the router. These utilities usually require a PC or laptop to be connected to a wired port on the router. If no device is available that has a wired connection, it may be necessary to configure the wireless client software on the laptop or tablet first.To connect to the router using a wired connection, plug an Ethernet patch cable into the network port on the computer. Plug the other end into a LAN port on the router. Do not plug the cable into the port or interface that is labeled “Internet”. The internet port will connect to the DSL or cable modem. Some home routers may have a built-in modem for internet connections. If this is the case, verify that the type of connection is correct for your internet service. A cable modem connection will have a coaxial terminal to accept a BNC-type connector. A DSL connection will have a port for a telephone-type cable, usually an RJ-11 connector.After confirming that the computer is connected to the network router and the link lights on the NIC indicate a working connection, the computer needs an IP address. Most network routers are set up so that the computer receives an IP address automatically from a local DHCP server automatically configured on the wireless router. If the computer does not have an IP address, check the router documentation and configure the PC or tablet with a unique IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS information.
4.4.2 Design Considerations
Before entering the configuration utility, or manually configuring the router through a web browser, you should consider how your network will be used. You do not want to configure the router and have that configuration limit what you are able to do on the network, nor do you want to leave your network unprotected.

4.5.2 Webster - Reflection Questions
I had such a good time taking this module at the beach, that I think I’m going to set up a wireless network at home. That way, I can keep up with this course anywhere in my home. Building your home network to be a wireless network just makes sense. I can work in the west side of my web and catch the sun setting, then move back to the east side in the morning. It’s so much nicer than being stuck at my desk all day! Have you set up your own home network? If not, could you do it if you had to?
