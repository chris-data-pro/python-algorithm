 Hi, my name is Rick Graziani. I teach computer networking at Cabrillo College and also at the University of California, Santa Cruz, in Santa Cruz, California. And I also have the pleasure of working with an amazing team of people at Cisco Systems that developed the Cisco networking academy courses. Although it might be my face you might see on a video, or my voice that you might hear, I want you to know that behind everything that you read, everything that you watch, everything that you do in these courses, is really just a amazing team of experts that are dedicated and passionate about helping you learn about networking. So you are about to undertake an exciting journey into this world of networking. You know, for me, it's like the one common language that truly unifies us all. Whether you're communicating with a friend next door, or somebody that you've never met halfway across the world. Networking is really that one language, those networking protocols, that you're going to be learning about, is the one language that is used throughout the world. No matter who you're communicating with, no matter where you're communicating from. Networking is also, to me, like a jigsaw puzzle. Learning networking, it's all these different protocols, all these different processes. Now first, they just might not make sense. And then the more you learn, you're going to see that these protocols and processes, how they all begin to fit together. And this whole picture of the internet and networking will become clearer. So I want you to know that you're not alone in this journey, that we're all behind you, everybody at Cisco Systems, they're truly passionate and dedicated in wanting to help you learn about networking. So from me and from everybody else on the team here at Cisco systems, we hope you enjoy your journey into this world of networking. And we'll see you soon. Broadcast news, they said, "Sit on your shirt." That doesn't seem to be helping. Is an extraordinary, thank you, lights. (ball clanking) Oh.
