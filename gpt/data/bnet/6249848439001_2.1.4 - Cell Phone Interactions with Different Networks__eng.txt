Video Title: Cell Phone Interactions with Different Networks__eng
Video URL: 
 - So let's think for a minute about some of the things we do on our cell phones. The first thing, obviously, is we talk. Because that's their primary function. So we talk to people on land lines and on other cell phones. And we talk to businesses. So basically we use one of the radios within the cell phone, and cell phones contain multiple radios, transmitters, and receivers, to do the talking. Then we also do data. And this is the kind of data that we use our data plan for. This is when we're looking up something on our cell phone when we're not near a regular Wi-Fi network. So we have the data plan network, which uses the cell phone infrastructure in order to be able to access the internet. We also have Wi-Fi. We use hotspots, and usually we also have a home wireless network. Most of us also use our cell phones as a way to get places. We use location services. Location services include our GPS, maps, places near me, and now many of us are also using our cell phones to pay for things. So we have pay services. We can take our cell phone next to the cash register or the receiver and automatically have our financial information transferred. So this is like cash registers, and payment pads. So we're going to talk a little bit now about the different kinds of networks that are used to access all of these various services.
