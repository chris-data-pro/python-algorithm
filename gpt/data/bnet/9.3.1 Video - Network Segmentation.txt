 In an ethernet LAN, devices use ethernet broadcast to contact all devices on the same local area network. For example, a device will send an ARP request on the local network to discover the associated MAC address. This is an ethernet broadcast searching for a known IPv4 address. Switches propagate broadcast out all interfaces except the interface on which it was received. Routers do not propagate broadcast. When a router receives a broadcast, it does not forward it out other interfaces. This is known as a layer to broadcast domain. Another example of an ethernet broadcast is a host sending a DHCP discover message to locate a DHCP server. The DHCP server provides an IPv4 address and other information to the client. Once again, switches propagate these broadcast out all interfaces except the interface on which it was received. The router will not propagate this ethernet broadcast out other interfaces. As you can see, this is a separate layer to broadcast domain. A router segments or separates layer to broadcast domains.
