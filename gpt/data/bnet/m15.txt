15.0.1 Webster - Why Should I Take this Module?
Kishori arrives at work early to get on a video conference call on the desktop computer at her nursing station. She logs into the session about mask protocol at the hospital. As she intently listens to the presenter, she notices a few dropped words. She wonders if it is a problem with the network. Is this similar to her tablet losing the connection for a moment? But then she remembers that she is using a computer that is hardwired to the network.Immediately after the call, she sends an email to Madhav in the IT department. Madhav comes to Kishori’s desk. She is confused because all of the devices do seem to be connected. Madhav explains that UDP and TCP are transport layer protocols that operate a little differently. He tells her that UDP is a 'best effort' delivery system that does not require acknowledgment of receipt. UDP is preferable with applications such as streaming audio and VoIP. UDP is used for video conference calls.Kishori had not heard of this before. Have you? In this module you will compare these protocols. Keep reading!

15.2.2 TCP and UDP Port Numbers
There are many services that we access through the internet in the course of a day. DNS, web, email, FTP, IM and VoIP are just some of these services that are provided by client/server systems around the world. These services may be provided by a single server or by several servers in large data centers.When a message is delivered using either TCP or UDP, the protocols and services requested are identified by a port number, as shown in the figure. A port is a numeric identifier within each segment that is used to keep track of specific conversations between a client and server. Every message that a host sends contains both a source and destination port.

When a message is received by a server, it is necessary for the server to be able to determine which service is being requested by the client. Clients are preconfigured to use a destination port that is registered on the internet for each service. An example of this is web browser clients which are preconfigured to send requests to web servers using port 80, the well-known port for HTTP web services.Ports are assigned and managed by an organization known as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Ports are broken into three categories and range in number from 1 to 65,535:Well-Known Ports - Destination ports that are associated with common network applications are identified as well-known ports. These ports are in the range of 1 to 1023.Registered Ports - Ports 1024 through 49151 can be used as either source or destination ports. These can be used by organizations to register specific applications such as IM applications.Private Ports - Ports 49152 through 65535 are often used as source ports. These ports can be used by any application.The table displays some common well-known port numbers and their associated applications.

Some applications may use both TCP and UDP. For example, DNS uses UDP when clients send requests to a DNS server. However, communication between two DNS servers always uses TCP.Search the IANA website for port registry to view the full list of port numbers and associated applications.
15.2.3 Socket Pairs
The source and destination ports are placed within the segment. The segments are then encapsulated within an IP packet. The IP packet contains the IP address of the source and destination. The combination of the source IP address and source port number, or the destination IP address and destination port number is known as a socket.In the example in the figure, the PC is simultaneously requesting FTP and web services from the destination server.

In the example, the FTP request generated by the PC includes the Layer 2 MAC addresses and the Layer 3 IP addresses. The request also identifies the source port number 1305 (dynamically generated by the host) and destination port, identifying the FTP services on port 21. The host also has requested a web page from the server using the same Layer 2 and Layer 3 addresses. However, it is using the source port number 1099 (dynamically generated by the host) and destination port identifying the web service on port 80.The socket is used to identify the server and service being requested by the client. A client socket might look like this, with 1099 representing the source port number: 192.168.1.5:1099The socket on a web server might be 192.168.1.7:80Together, these two sockets combine to form a socket pair: 192.168.1.5:1099, 192.168.1.7:80Sockets enable multiple processes, running on a client, to distinguish themselves from each other, and multiple connections to a server process to be distinguished from each other.The source port number acts as a return address for the requesting application. The transport layer keeps track of this port and the application that initiated the request so that when a response is returned, it can be forwarded to the correct application.
15.2.4 The netstat Command
Unexplained TCP connections can pose a major security threat. They can indicate that something or someone is connected to the local host. Sometimes it is necessary to know which active TCP connections are open and running on a networked host. Netstat is an important network utility that can be used to verify those connections. As shown below, enter the command netstat to list the protocols in use, the local address and port numbers, the foreign address and port numbers, and the connection state.

By default, the netstat command will attempt to resolve IP addresses to domain names and port numbers to well-known applications. The -n option can be used to display IP addresses and port numbers in their numerical form.

15.3.2 Webster - Reflection Questions
I once ordered some furniture from one of those online stores. It was sent to me in three different boxes, over the span of two weeks. I was not worried that anything was missing because I received email updates that detailed the location of each box along its route from the store to my home. That example is like TCP. All along the route, there are built-in checks to ensure that what needs to be delivered gets delivered, and in the right order.There is still a need for UDP in networking. I would not enjoy streaming a movie where it stops for minutes at a time waiting for the network to send the next scene. Can you think of a good analogy for UDP?
