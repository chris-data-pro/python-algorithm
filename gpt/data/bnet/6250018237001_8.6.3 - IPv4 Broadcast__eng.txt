Video Title: IPv4 Broadcast__eng
Video URL: 
 - In this video, we're going to take a look at broadcast transmissions. So we have a packet with the source IPv4 address 172.16.4.1 and a destination IPv4 address of 255.255.255.255. That's a special address, meaning it's destined for all devices all on the network. It's known as a broadcast. If we take a look here, the packet leaves the source 172.16.4.1 and notice that our Ethernet switch flooded out the packet out all ports, except the incoming port. And it was received by every device on the network. Now when this router receives the broadcast, it'll not forward the broadcast packet to other networks. But a broadcast means every device on the network will receive the IPv4 packet.
