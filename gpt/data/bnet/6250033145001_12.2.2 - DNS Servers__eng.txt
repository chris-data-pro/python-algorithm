Video Title: DNS Servers__eng

 - In this video, we're going to introduce the DNS server. DNS stands for Domain Name System server. DNS server is used to associate a domain name, or a host name, with an IP address. Let's take a look. Here we have a user that's going to go to the website www.cisco.com. However, the network, the internet, doesn't understand domain names like cisco.com. It only understands IP addresses. So the system needs to associate an IP address with this domain name, so in this case it's going to ask a DNS server. So the system's going to contact the DNS server and ask it for the IP address associated with www.cisco.com. The query, the question, for this domain name goes to the DNS server. The DNS server looks up www.cisco.com, finds the IP address, and then returns this IP address to the host. The host can now use this IP address to contact the web server www.cisco.com, and in this case, download the proper information to display the webpage.
