 - In this video, we're going to take a look at unicast IP transmission. So here we have POST 172.16.4.1. It's going to send a unicast packet, that's a packet where the destination IP address is destined for a single device. And it's going to send it to the destination IP address of the printer at 172.16.4.253. So the source IP address is 172.16.4.1 and the destination IP address of the packet is 172.16.4.253. So we can see here that the packet goes from a single device to a single device, in this case the printer. And, by the way, a source IP address can only be a unicast. What we mean by that is a packet can only originate from a single device. In this case, the destination address is also a unicast meaning it's destined only for a single device.
