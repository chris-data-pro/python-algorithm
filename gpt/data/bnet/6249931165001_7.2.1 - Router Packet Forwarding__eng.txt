Video Title: Router Packet Forwarding__eng
Video URL: 
 - In this video, we're going to take a look at how a router forwards packets from one network to another network. So in this example, we have Host at 10.0.0.1, wants to send a packet to 192.168.1.2, which is in another network. So the source IP address of the packet will be 10.0.0.1, the destination IPv4 address of the packet will be 192.168.1.2. So H1 sends the packet to its default gateway, the router. Now it sends it to the router because it knows-- H1 knows that the destination, H4 it's IPv4 address is on a different network. The router receives the packet, and it looks up the destination IPv4 address of the packet in its routing table. It notices that the IPv4 address, the destination IPv4 address, 192.168.1.2 is on the 192.168.1.0 network. And that network is on its Fast Ethernet 02 interface. So the router will go ahead and forward this packet out its Fast Ethernet 02 interface towards the final destination. Now in this case, H1 has a packet to send to the destination IPv4 address 255.255.255.255. If you remember, that's a broadcast address. So a broadcast will be sent to all devices on its network. You'll notice the router will receive this broadcast but will not forward this packet out to other networks.
