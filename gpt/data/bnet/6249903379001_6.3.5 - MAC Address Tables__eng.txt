Video Title: MAC Address Tables__eng
Video URL: 
 - In this video, we're going to take a look at how a switch builds it's MAC address table. Once again, a switch makes it's forwarding decision based on layer two information, in this case the Ethernet header information of the Ethernet frame. So let's take a look at how this switch builds it's MAC address table. On these four hosts, I have abbreviated MAC addresses AA-AA through DD-DD. So here we're going to have H1 send an Ethernet frame to H4 so the source MAC address will be AA-AA the MAC address of H1's Ethernet NIC and the destination address will be that of H4's Ethernet NIC, DD-DD. Okay, so H1 sends that frame on to the Ethernet switch. When the switch receives any Ethernet frame, the first thing it does is it looks at the source MAC address and says "Have I learned anything?" What's it's looking at is it sees that on it's port fast Ethernet 01 is the source MAC address AA-AA. Does that exist in it's table? And it sees, it says no, it doesn't because it doesn't already exist, it adds this source MAC address to the incoming port fast Ethernet 01. So let's put that right there. So that's how the switch builds it's table. Now it wants to go ahead and forward the frame. So now it looks at the destination MAC address. It says "Is this MAC address in my table?" and as we can see, DD-DD is not in it's table. This is known as an unknown unicast. From the perspective of the switch, it's like, I didn't know where to send it, so what it does is it acts like the old Ethernet hubs. It will actually send it out every port except the incoming port. So each one of these devices will actually receive this Ethernet frame. When an H2 receives it, it's Ethernet NIC card compares it's MAC address to the destination MAC address of the Ethernet frame and goes "we're not a match." So it ignores the rest of the frame. See, the H3 does the same thing. My MAC address doesn't match the MAC address of the destination MAC, ignore the frame. H4, when it receives this Ethernet frame, its Ethernet NIC card goes "Yeah, that is my MAC address. We are a match." So it goes ahead and receives the entire frame. Now let's see what happens when DD sends an Ethernet frame back to AA-AA or H4 sends an Ethernet frame to H1. So in this case, we have H4 as the source and the destination is H1. Now so far, this is the MAC address table of our switch. So H4 sends the Ethernet frame, it's received on port fast Ethernet 04 by the switch. Remember, the first thing a switch does is it wants to learn. It examines the source MAC address and says "Have I learned anything new? "Because I've received this source MAC address on my port, "fast Ethernet 04. It's not in my MAC address table." So it adds the MAC address. Next, I need to forward the frame. Do I know where the destination MAC address is? It looks it up and says "Yeah, I know it's on my fast Ethernet 01 port." So it goes ahead, in this case it knows about where the destination MAC address is and it can filter the frame and just send it out the single port. So you can see how Ethernet switches build their tables, learn about where the Ethernet source MAC address are, and then can start to filter forward these frames out specific ports. Let's take a final look here at another frame going from H1 to H4 and see how things have changed now. If H1 has another frame to send back to H4, the source MAC address is AA-AA, the destination MAC address is DD-DD and let's take a look at the difference from the first time this happened. The frame enters the switch, the port says "Do I know about this source MAC address "on fast Ethernet 01?" It says, "yeah, I've learned about it previously." So switches tend to keep this information in there for about five minutes. It says okay, I've learned that, no problem. How about forwarding the frame? Where am I going to send it? So it looks at the destination MAC address and says "Do I know where DD-DD is? This time, I do know. "It's over here on port fast Ethernet 04." So instead of sending it out all ports like we did originally, when this information was not here, now it can send it out just fast Ethernet 04 on it's way to H4.

of the Ethernet frame.
Timestamp: 00:00:24.849 - 00:00:28.703 Text: So let's take a look at
how this switch builds
Timestamp: 00:00:28.703 - 00:00:31.240 Text: it's MAC address table.
Timestamp: 00:00:31.240 - 00:00:35.794 Text: On these four hosts, I have
abbreviated MAC addresses
Timestamp: 00:00:35.794 - 00:00:37.461 Text: AA-AA through DD-DD.
Timestamp: 00:00:39.817 - 00:00:43.984 Text: So here we're going to have H1
send an Ethernet frame to H4
Timestamp: 00:00:45.571 - 00:00:48.821 Text: so the source MAC address will be AA-AA
Timestamp: 00:00:52.553 - 00:00:56.183 Text: the MAC address of H1's Ethernet NIC
Timestamp: 00:00:56.183 - 00:00:58.921 Text: and the destination address will be that
Timestamp: 00:00:58.921 - 00:01:01.254 Text: of H4's Ethernet NIC, DD-DD.
Timestamp: 00:01:06.304 - 00:01:10.471 Text: Okay, so H1 sends that frame
on to the Ethernet switch.
Timestamp: 00:01:14.440 - 00:01:17.477 Text: When the switch receives
any Ethernet frame,
Timestamp: 00:01:17.477 - 00:01:19.393 Text: the first thing it does is it looks
Timestamp: 00:01:19.393 - 00:01:21.307 Text: at the source MAC address and says
Timestamp: 00:01:21.307 - 00:01:24.133 Text: "Have I learned anything?"
Timestamp: 00:01:24.133 - 00:01:28.146 Text: What's it's looking at is
it sees that on it's port
Timestamp: 00:01:28.146 - 00:01:32.229 Text: fast Ethernet 01 is the
source MAC address AA-AA.
Timestamp: 00:01:33.662 - 00:01:36.480 Text: Does that exist in it's table?
Timestamp: 00:01:36.480 - 00:01:39.247 Text: And it sees, it says no, it doesn't
Timestamp: 00:01:39.247 - 00:01:43.439 Text: because it doesn't already
exist, it adds this source MAC
Timestamp: 00:01:43.439 - 00:01:47.272 Text: address to the incoming
port fast Ethernet 01.
Timestamp: 00:01:50.619 - 00:01:53.119 Text: So let's put that right there.
Timestamp: 00:01:56.117 - 00:01:58.864 Text: So that's how the switch
builds it's table.
Timestamp: 00:01:58.864 - 00:02:01.855 Text: Now it wants to go ahead
and forward the frame.
Timestamp: 00:02:01.855 - 00:02:05.004 Text: So now it looks at the
destination MAC address.
Timestamp: 00:02:05.004 - 00:02:08.587 Text: It says "Is this MAC address in my table?"
Timestamp: 00:02:08.587 - 00:02:12.420 Text: and as we can see, DD-DD
is not in it's table.
Timestamp: 00:02:14.960 - 00:02:17.310 Text: This is known as an unknown unicast.
Timestamp: 00:02:17.310 - 00:02:19.447 Text: From the perspective of
the switch, it's like,

Timestamp: 00:02:33.356 - 00:02:36.578 Text: So each one of these devices
will actually receive
Timestamp: 00:02:36.578 - 00:02:38.311 Text: this Ethernet frame.
Timestamp: 00:02:38.311 - 00:02:42.753 Text: When an H2 receives it,
it's Ethernet NIC card
Timestamp: 00:02:42.753 - 00:02:46.920 Text: compares it's MAC address to
the destination MAC address
Timestamp: 00:02:48.085 - 00:02:51.107 Text: of the Ethernet frame and
goes "we're not a match."
Timestamp: 00:02:51.107 - 00:02:54.844 Text: So it ignores the rest of the frame.
Timestamp: 00:02:54.844 - 00:02:57.511 Text: See, the H3 does the same thing.
Timestamp: 00:02:58.725 - 00:03:01.418 Text: My MAC address doesn't
match the MAC address
Timestamp: 00:03:01.418 - 00:03:05.440 Text: of the destination MAC, ignore the frame.
Timestamp: 00:03:05.440 - 00:03:08.857 Text: H4, when it receives this Ethernet frame,
Timestamp: 00:03:09.891 - 00:03:12.488 Text: its Ethernet NIC card goes
Timestamp: 00:03:12.488 - 00:03:16.618 Text: "Yeah, that is my MAC
address. We are a match."
Timestamp: 00:03:16.618 - 00:03:20.139 Text: So it goes ahead and
receives the entire frame.
Timestamp: 00:03:20.139 - 00:03:24.306 Text: Now let's see what happens
when DD sends an Ethernet frame
Timestamp: 00:03:26.000 - 00:03:30.167 Text: back to AA-AA or H4 sends
an Ethernet frame to H1.
Timestamp: 00:03:37.279 - 00:03:38.612 Text: So in this case,
Timestamp: 00:03:39.637 - 00:03:41.637 Text: we have H4 as the source
Timestamp: 00:03:47.486 - 00:03:49.653 Text: and the destination is H1.
Timestamp: 00:03:53.308 - 00:03:57.475 Text: Now so far, this is the MAC
address table of our switch.
Timestamp: 00:03:59.402 - 00:04:03.569 Text: So H4 sends the Ethernet
frame, it's received on port
Timestamp: 00:04:04.725 - 00:04:07.869 Text: fast Ethernet 04 by the switch.
Timestamp: 00:04:07.869 - 00:04:09.465 Text: Remember, the first thing a switch does
Timestamp: 00:04:09.465 - 00:04:10.968 Text: is it wants to learn.
Timestamp: 00:04:10.968 - 00:04:13.991 Text: It examines the source
MAC address and says
Timestamp: 00:04:13.991 - 00:04:16.325 Text: "Have I learned anything new?
Timestamp: 00:04:16.325 - 00:04:20.348 Text: "Because I've received this
source MAC address on my port,
Timestamp: 00:04:20.348 - 00:04:24.800 Text: "fast Ethernet 04. It's not
in my MAC address table."
Timestamp: 00:04:24.800 - 00:04:27.050 Text: So it adds the MAC address.
Timestamp: 00:04:31.247 - 00:04:34.080 Text: Next, I need to forward the frame.
Timestamp: 00:04:35.058 - 00:04:38.314 Text: Do I know where the
destination MAC address is?
Timestamp: 00:04:38.314 - 00:04:39.339 Text: It looks it up and says
Timestamp: 00:04:39.339 - 00:04:43.339 Text: "Yeah, I know it's on my
fast Ethernet 01 port."
Timestamp: 00:04:45.792 - 00:04:49.594 Text: So it goes ahead, in this case it knows
Timestamp: 00:04:49.594 - 00:04:53.761 Text: about where the destination MAC
address is and it can filter
Timestamp: 00:04:56.090 - 00:05:00.007 Text: the frame and just send
it out the single port.
Timestamp: 00:05:01.599 - 00:05:05.766 Text: So you can see how Ethernet
switches build their tables,
Timestamp: 00:05:07.397 - 00:05:11.564 Text: learn about where the Ethernet
source MAC address are,
Timestamp: 00:05:14.381 - 00:05:17.913 Text: and then can start to
filter forward these frames
Timestamp: 00:05:17.913 - 00:05:19.852 Text: out specific ports.
Timestamp: 00:05:19.852 - 00:05:23.602 Text: Let's take a final look
here at another frame
Timestamp: 00:05:26.202 - 00:05:30.369 Text: going from H1 to H4 and see
how things have changed now.
Timestamp: 00:05:33.652 - 00:05:38.022 Text: If H1 has another frame
to send back to H4,
Timestamp: 00:05:38.022 - 00:05:40.689 Text: the source MAC address is AA-AA,
Timestamp: 00:05:42.969 - 00:05:45.969 Text: the destination MAC address is DD-DD
Timestamp: 00:05:46.874 - 00:05:49.412 Text: and let's take a look at the difference
Timestamp: 00:05:49.412 - 00:05:52.123 Text: from the first time this happened.
Timestamp: 00:05:52.123 - 00:05:55.259 Text: The frame enters the switch, the port says
Timestamp: 00:05:55.259 - 00:05:58.539 Text: "Do I know about this source MAC address
Timestamp: 00:05:58.539 - 00:06:01.114 Text: "on fast Ethernet 01?"
Timestamp: 00:06:01.114 - 00:06:05.446 Text: It says, "yeah, I've learned
about it previously."
Timestamp: 00:06:05.446 - 00:06:07.995 Text: So switches tend to keep
this information in there
Timestamp: 00:06:07.995 - 00:06:10.448 Text: for about five minutes.
Timestamp: 00:06:10.448 - 00:06:14.145 Text: It says okay, I've
learned that, no problem.
Timestamp: 00:06:14.145 - 00:06:16.117 Text: How about forwarding the frame?
Timestamp: 00:06:16.117 - 00:06:17.969 Text: Where am I going to send it?

is? This time, I do know.
Timestamp: 00:06:26.049 - 00:06:29.549 Text: "It's over here on port fast Ethernet 04."
Timestamp: 00:06:30.692 - 00:06:33.515 Text: So instead of sending it out all ports
Timestamp: 00:06:33.515 - 00:06:38.183 Text: like we did originally, when
this information was not here,
Timestamp: 00:06:38.183 - 00:06:41.850 Text: now it can send it out
just fast Ethernet 04
Timestamp: 00:06:43.218 - 00:06:44.718 Text: on it's way to H4.
