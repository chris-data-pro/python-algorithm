7.0.1 Webster - Why Should I Take this Module?
During a lunch break, Kishori sees her friend, Rina, and they decide to eat together. Rina works as an IT support technician at the hospital. Kishori thinks this might be a good opportunity to ask Rina a question she’s been pondering. Kishori now knows that her desktop computer in the nurses’ station connects to the network using a twisted-pair cable. Most other devices she uses connect to the network wirelessly. She wonders if there is any difference in the way wired and wireless devices communicate on the network. Rina knows that Kishori has relatives in the United States. She explains that the differences between wired and wireless network communication is similar to the differences in addressing formats used for mailing packages to different countries. The contents inside might be exactly the same, but the addressing and possibly packaging could be very different.How does a message get delivered? When you write a letter and place it in the envelope, you need to make sure it has the correct address information to be delivered to the recipient. In your network, the process of placing one message format (the letter) inside another message format (the envelope) is called encapsulation. Ready to learn more? Take this module!

7.1.1 Video - The Fields of the Ethernet Frame
Ethernet is technology commonly used in local area networks. Devices access the Ethernet LAN using an Ethernet Network Interface Card (NIC). Each Ethernet NIC has a unique address permanently embedded on the card known as a Media Access Control (MAC) address. The MAC address for both the source and destination are fields in an Ethernet frame.Press the Play button to watch the video.
7.1.2 Encapsulation
When sending a letter, the letter writer uses an accepted format to ensure that the letter is delivered and understood by the recipient. In the same way, a message that is sent over a computer network follows specific format rules in order for it to be delivered and processed.The process of placing one message format (the letter) inside another message format (the envelope) is called encapsulation. De-encapsulation occurs when the process is reversed by the recipient and the letter is removed from the envelope. Just as a letter is encapsulated in an envelope for delivery, so computer messages are encapsulated.Each computer message is encapsulated in a specific format, called a frame, before it is sent over the network. A frame acts like an envelope; it provides the address of the intended destination and the address of the source host. The format and contents of a frame are determined by the type of message being sent and the channel over which it is communicated. Messages that are not correctly formatted are not successfully delivered to or processed by the destination host.Click each button for an analogy and a network example of message formatting and encapsulation.

7.3.2 Webster - Reflection Questions
There is a lot going on behind the scenes when I send an email to a friend. Way more than I knew about! Data gets encapsulated when I send an email and then it's de-encapsulated when my friend opens that email. The access layer of the OSI model is where all of this happens. Now that you know about encapsulation and the access layer, what else do you do on your computer, tablet, or smartphone that requires encapsulation and the protocols used at the access layer?
