Well done! You've reached the end of Module 2 and completed a major milestone in your Python programming education. Here's a short summary of the topic areas you've covered in Module 2:how to write and run simple Python programs;what Python literals, operators, and expressions are;what variables are and what are the rules that govern them;how to perform basic input and output operations.You are now ready to take the module test, which will both help you gauge what you've learned so far.The following test is based on what you have just learned. There are twenty questions in total and you need to score at least 70% to pass.

Good luck!

1.2 The print() function
Where do the functions come from?
From Python itself
They may come from Python itself; the print function is one of this kind; such a function is an added value received together with Python and its environment (it is built-in); you don't have to do anything special (e.g., ask anyone for anything) if you want to make use of it;
From modules
They may come from one or more of Python's add-ons named modules; some of the modules come with Python, others may require separate installation - whatever the case, they all need to be explicitly connected with your code (we'll show you how to do that soon);
From your code
You can write them yourself, placing as many functions as you want and need inside your program to make it simpler, clearer and more elegant.
