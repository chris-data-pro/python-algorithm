date dimension
----------------
date_key(PK)
date
year
month
day

All Data models always need an explicit date dimension table. 
There are many date components that are not supported by the SQL date function, 
including week numbers, fiscal years, seasons, holidays, workdays and weekends. 
Rather than attempting to determine these calculations in a query, 
its would be easy to store in the date dimension table.
Here for simplicity I only list year month and day.

DATABASE DESIGN
There are two choices to define the database schema: SQL and NoSQL.
We can use traditional database management system like MsSQL or MySQL to keep data. 
As you know, we should keep information about videos and users into RDBMS.  
Other information about videos, called metadata, should be kept too. 
Now we have the main three tables to keep data. 
(Notice that we just only think the basic properties of Youtube. 
1. Users should be able to upload videos.
2. Our services should be able to record stats of videos, e.g., likes/dislikes, total number of views, etc.
3. Users should be able to add and view comments on videos.
We don't cover the channels, subscriptions, and recommendation system).
