Divide and Conquer 
----------------------------- 
- The Scalability Technique
This is the scalability technique. Everything is about partitioning out work. Deciding how to execute it. 
Applies to many things, from web tier, you have a lot of web servers that are more or less identically and 
independently and you grow them horizontally. That’s divide and conquer.

- This is the crux of database sharding. How do you partitions things out and communicate between the parts that you’ve 
subdivided. These are things you want to figure out early on because they influence how you grow.

- Simple and loose connections are really valuable.

- The dynamic nature of Python is a win here. No matter how bad your API is you can stub or modify or decorate your way 
out of a lot of problems.
