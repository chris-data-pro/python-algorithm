SELECT column1, function_name(column2)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column_name(s);

1. GROUP BY clause is placed after the WHERE clause.
2. GROUP BY clause is placed before ORDER BY clause if used any.
3. The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions. like SUM(), COUNT() etc.
4. QUALIFY clause is placed after HAVING clause, before ORDER BY clause if used any.

SELECT site_name, count(month_id) as ct, row_number() over (order by site_name) 
FROM "COLLAB_DB"."COLLAB_DS2_CSSTG"."PM_WBX_SITE_USAGE_MLY_WITH_PREDICTIVE_FEATURES" 
WHERE TOT_LICENSES > 100
GROUP BY site_name
HAVING ct < 4
QUALIFY row_number() over (order by site_name) < 5
ORDER BY 3


OUTPUT:

SITE_NAME       CT  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY SITE_NAME)
1800flowers     2                   1
1compass-group  2                   2

220ict          3                   4


5. Window function can only be inside SELECT, QUALIFY or ORDER BY clauses


SELECT site_name, count(month_id) as ct, row_number() over (order by ct DESC) 
FROM "COLLAB_DB"."COLLAB_DS2_CSSTG"."PM_WBX_SITE_USAGE_MLY_WITH_PREDICTIVE_FEATURES" 
WHERE TOT_LICENSES > 100
GROUP BY site_name
HAVING ct > 20
QUALIFY row_number() over (order by ct DESC) < 5
ORDER BY 3


OUTPUT:

SITE_NAME  CT  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY CT DESC)
