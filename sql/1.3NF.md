3rd Normal Form (3NF):
A DB schema design approach for relational DB
Uses normalizing principles to reduce the duplication of data

1. meet NF if all the attributes (cols) are functionally dependent on the primary key
2. e.g. patients table includes a col for the phone number of their doctor - failure
3. this col would be better stored in the doctors table 
   (if a doctor's phone number changes, we only change 1 record in doctors table)

A table is in 3NF if and only if both of the following conditions hold:
1. The relation R (table) is in second normal form (2NF). 
2. Every non-prime attribute of R is non-transitively dependent on every key of R.

Requiring existence of "the key" ensures that the table is in 1NF; 
requiring that non-key attributes be dependent on "the whole key" ensures 2NF; 
requiring that non-key attributes be dependent on "nothing but the key" ensures 3NF.

Example: 
Splitting the following cols into 2 tables is called normalization,
the process of structuring a database, usually a relational database, 
in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms 
in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.
